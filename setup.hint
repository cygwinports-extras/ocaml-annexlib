ldesc: "Annexlib contains useful routines for Objective Caml that aren't 
in the standard library (Especially string searching and manipulation), 
and some other odds and ends that are useful at times. Highlights 
include wildcard globbing, lots of string searching and manipulation 
routines, locale support, ~user-style path expansion, and more."
